////Respected Sir,
We know that we were assigned FPGA project but as we all are currently at our respective homes, we have requested you to kindly 
assign us the project that could be done online.
As of now we don't have any clear instruction on how we are supposed to do this project.
So, we have not defined FPGA input/output pins, which we will do once we get an clear instruction.
